## Supported Entities

- `sensor` for measuring battery levels and watering history of `sprinkler_timer` devices as well as the device on/off state (not to be confused with zone on/off switches).
- `temperature sensor` for measuring the temperature at the device and alarm attribute for above/below threshold.
- `switch` for turning a zone on/off, enabling/disabling rain delays and toggling pre-configured programs.
- `binary_sensor` for detecting water leaks or flooding.

## Installation

Recommended installation is via HACS.

## Configuration

```yaml
bhyve:
  username: !secret bhyve_username
  password: !secret bhyve_password

sensor:
  - platform: bhyve

switch:
  - platform: bhyve

binary_sensor:
  - platform: bhyve
```

## Sensor Entities

### Device Battery Sensor

A **battery** `sensor` entity is created for any device which has a battery level to report.

### Device State sensor

A **device state** `sensor` entity is created for each device. This reports the state of the device, for example `auto` or `off`. A device may be switched to `off` either manually through the BHyve app, or may be automatically set when battery levels are too low to operate the device correctly.

### Zone Watering History sensor

A **zone history** `sensor` entity is created for each zone. This reports the history of zone watering.

The following attributes are set on zone history sensor entities:

| Attribute             | Type     | Notes                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `budget`              | `number` | The watering budget used.                                   |
| `program`             | `string` | The program letter which triggered the watering event.      |

| `start_time`          | `string` | The start time of the watering.                             |

## Switch Entities

### Zone Switch

A **zone** `switch` entity is created for each zone of a `sprinkler_timer` device. This switch enables starting/stopping irrigation of a zone. Turning on the switch will enable watering of the zone for the amount of time configured in the BHyve app &mdash; it is not possible to configure the default runtime value via this integration at this time, however it's configured value is available via the `manual_preset_runtime` attribute. In order to water a zone for a specific number of minutes, please use the `start_watering` service call.

The following attributes are set on zone switch entities:

| Attribute                     | Type           | Notes                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zone_name`                   | `string`       | The name of the zone                                                       |

| `manual_preset_runtime`       | `number`       | The number of seconds to run zone watering when switch is turned on.       |
| `smart_watering_enabled`      | `boolean`      | True if the zone has a smart water schedule enabled.                       |
| `sprinkler_type`              | `string`       | The configured type of sprinker.                                           |

| `program_x`                   | `object`       | Provides details on any configured watering programs for the given switch. |
| `program_e[watering_program]` | `list[string]` | List of timestamps for future/scheduled watering times.<sup>†</sup>        |

<sup>†</sup> Only applicable if a Smart Watering program is enabled. Any rain delays or other custom programs must be considered separately.

#### `program_x` attribute

Any watering programs which are configured for a zone switch are made available as an attribute. The `X` denotes the letter of the program slot. Values `A`, `B` and `C` are well known custom slots. Program `E` is reserved for the Smart Watering plan. Slot `D` does not have a known use at this stage.

Please see [program switches](#program-switch) below for more details.

### Rain Delay Switch

A **rain delay** `switch` entity is created for each discovered `sprinkler_timer` device. This entity will be **on** whenever BHyve reports that a device's watering schedule will be delayed due to weather conditions.

Enabling the switch will set a 24 hour rain delay on the device &mdash; for a custom rain delay, please use the `enable_rain_delay` service.

The following attributes are set on `switch.*_rain_delay` entities, if the sensor is on:

| Attribute      | Type     | Notes                                                                                     |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cause`        | `string` | Why a delay was put in place. Values seen: `auto`. May be empty.                          |
| `delay`        | `number` | The number of hours the delay is in place. NB: This is hours from `started_at` attribute. |
| `weather_type` | `string` | The reported cause of the weather delay. Values seen: `wind`, `rain`. May be empty.       |
| `started_at`   | `string` | The timestamp the delay was put in place.                                                 |

## Python Script

Bundled in this repository is a [`python_script`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/python_script) which calculates a device's next watering time and when a rain delay is scheduled to finish.

_Note: HACS does not install the script automatically and they must be added manually to your HA instance._

### Scripts

#### [`bhyve_next_watering.py`](https://github.com/sebr/bhyve-home-assistant/blob/master/python_scripts/bhyve_next_watering.py)

Calculates:

1. When the next scheduled watering is for a zone by considering all enabled watering programs
2. When a device's active rain delay will finish, or `None` if there is no active delay

This script creates or updates entities named `sensor.{zone_name}_next_watering` and `sensor.{device_name}_rain_delay_finishing`.

Usage:

```yaml
service: python_script.bhyve_next_watering
data:
  entity_id: switch.backyard_zone
```

| Argument    | Type     | Required | Notes                            |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | `string` | `True`   | The entity id for a zone switch. |

### Automation

Hook these scripts up to automations to update as required:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: BHyve next watering & rain delay finishing updater
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: switch.backyard_zone, switch.rain_delay_lawn
      - platform: homeassistant
        event: start
    action:
      - service: python_script.bhyve_next_watering
        data:
          entity_id: switch.backyard_zone
```
